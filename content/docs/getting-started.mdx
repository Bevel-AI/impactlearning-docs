# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through creating your first learning experience with Impact. In just a few minutes, you'll have professional learning content ready to share.

## Step 1: Start a New Project

When you open Impact, you'll see the welcome screen with template options. You can either:

- **Choose a template** — Select from Assessment, Scenario Training, Gamified Learning, or other starters
- **Start from scratch** — Type your own prompt describing what you want to create

## Step 2: Describe Your Learning Experience

In the chat input, describe what you want to create. Be specific about:

- **Topic** — What subject matter should the content cover?
- **Audience** — Who will be learning this content?
- **Learning objectives** — What should learners be able to do afterward?
- **Format** — Scenario, assessment, gamified experience, role-play?
- **Style** — Formal, casual, technical, beginner-friendly?

### Example Prompts

Here are some prompts to get you started:

```
Build a scenario-based training for handling customer complaints. 
Include branching paths based on the learner's choices and feedback 
on their decisions.
```

```
Design a gamified onboarding experience for new sales team members.
Include points, badges, and a leaderboard to track progress.
```

```
Create an assessment tool for testing cybersecurity awareness 
with multiple question types and detailed feedback.
```

```
Build a role-play simulation for practicing difficult conversations 
with employees, including realistic dialogue options.
```

## Step 3: Add Source Materials (Optional)

Enhance your content by uploading reference materials. Impact can use these to inform the generated content:

### Supported File Formats

| Type | Formats |
|------|---------|
| **Documents** | PDF |
| **Images** | PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP |
| **Text** | Markdown (.md) |
| **Video** | MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI, or YouTube links |

Simply drag and drop files into the chat, or click the attachment button to upload.

**Tip:** Upload existing training materials, brand guidelines, or reference documents — Impact will incorporate the information into your learning content.

## Step 4: Watch the Live Preview

As Impact generates your content, you'll see it appear in real-time in the preview panel on the right side of the screen. The preview shows:

- Your learning content as learners will experience it
- Interactive elements you can test
- Progress tracking and navigation
- Responsive design across devices

## Step 5: Iterate and Refine

Not quite right? Simply ask for changes:

- *"Make the introduction more engaging"*
- *"Add more interactive elements to lesson 3"*
- *"Include a knowledge check after each section"*
- *"Add branching paths based on quiz results"*
- *"Change the theme to be more playful"*

Impact remembers your conversation context, so you can refine incrementally.

## Step 6: Save and Share

Your projects are automatically saved. You can:

- **Continue later** — Access your projects from the sidebar
- **Favorite** — Star important projects for quick access
- **Publish** — Share your content with learners
