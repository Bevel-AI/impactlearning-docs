# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through creating your first slide presentation with Impact. In just a few minutes, you'll have a professional e-learning deck ready to share.

## Step 1: Start a New Project

When you open Impact, you'll see the welcome screen with template options. You can either:

- **Choose a template** — Select from Course Platform, Slide Deck, or other starters
- **Start from scratch** — Type your own prompt describing what you want to create

## Step 2: Describe Your Content

In the chat input, describe what you want to create. Be specific about:

- **Topic** — What subject matter should the content cover?
- **Audience** — Who will be viewing this content?
- **Style** — Formal, casual, technical, beginner-friendly?
- **Length** — How many slides or lessons do you need?

### Example Prompts

Here are some prompts to get you started:

```
Create a 10-slide presentation about workplace safety basics 
for new employees. Include key statistics and actionable tips.
```

```
Build a course platform for learning JavaScript fundamentals 
with 5 lessons, each containing explanations and practice exercises.
```

```
Design an onboarding slide deck for our marketing team. 
Cover our brand guidelines, tools we use, and team processes.
```

## Step 3: Watch the Live Preview

As Impact generates your content, you'll see it appear in real-time in the preview panel on the right side of the screen. The preview shows:

- Your slides in 16:9 format
- Keyboard navigation (use arrow keys)
- Progress indicator
- Responsive design

## Step 4: Iterate and Refine

Not quite right? Simply ask for changes:

- *"Make the introduction slide more engaging"*
- *"Add more visuals to slide 3"*
- *"Include a quiz at the end"*
- *"Change the color scheme to blue"*

Impact remembers your conversation context, so you can refine incrementally.

## Step 5: Save and Share

Your projects are automatically saved. You can:

- **Continue later** — Access your projects from the sidebar
- **Favorite** — Star important projects for quick access
- **Publish** — Share your content with others (coming soon)
