# Image Generation

Impact Learning can generate custom images for your learning content using AI. Simply describe what you need, and the AI will create illustrations, diagrams, and visuals tailored to your content.

## Supported Models

### Google Gemini Image

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** | Fast multimodal image generation with excellent text understanding |
| **Gemini 3.0 Pro Image** | High quality images with superior prompt following |

### OpenAI

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **GPT Image 1.5** | OpenAI's latest image generation model |

## How It Works

When you ask Impact to create an image:

1. **Describe what you need** — "Create an illustration showing the water cycle for a science lesson"
2. **AI generates the image** — The selected model creates a custom image
3. **Image is added to your content** — Automatically inserted into your learning material
4. **Stored securely** — Images are saved to your project for reuse

## Aspect Ratios

Impact supports multiple aspect ratios for different use cases:

| Aspect Ratio | Best For |
|--------------|----------|
| **16:9** | Presentations, course content (default) |
| **1:1** | Social media, thumbnails |
| **9:16** | Mobile-first content, stories |
| **4:3** | Traditional presentations |
| **3:2** | Photography-style images |

## Example Prompts

Here are effective prompts for learning content:

```
Create a friendly cartoon illustration of a neuron 
firing, suitable for a biology course for beginners.
```

```
Generate a professional diagram showing the 
agile development cycle with labeled stages.
```

```
Design an engaging hero image for a leadership 
training course with diverse professionals.
```

Be specific in your image prompts! Include details about style (cartoon, professional, minimalist), audience (children, professionals), and purpose (hero image, diagram, illustration).

## Reference Images

You can provide reference images to guide generation:

1. Upload an image to the chat
2. Ask the AI to create something similar or inspired by it
3. The AI uses your reference to inform the new generation

This is useful for maintaining visual consistency across your learning content.
