# SCORM Export

Export your Impact Learning content as SCORM packages to use in any Learning Management System (LMS). SCORM is the industry standard for e-learning content interoperability.

## What is SCORM?

**SCORM** (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) is a set of standards that allows e-learning content to work with any compliant LMS. When you export as SCORM:

- Content can be uploaded to your organization's LMS
- Learner progress is tracked automatically
- Completion status is reported to the LMS
- Works with thousands of LMS platforms

## SCORM Versions

Impact Learning exports **SCORM 1.2** packages, which are:

- Compatible with virtually all LMS platforms
- Well-tested and reliable
- Supported by: Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, SAP SuccessFactors, Cornerstone, and more

## What's Included in the Package

Your SCORM export contains:

| `index.html` | Entry point for the learning content |
| `/assets/` | JavaScript, CSS, and media files |
| `/images/` | Generated and uploaded images |
| `/audio/` | Generated narration files |

## Tracking and Completion

### Progress Tracking

The exported content reports to the LMS:

- **Completion status** — Whether the learner finished
- **Success status** — Pass/fail if assessments exist
- **Score** — Percentage if scoring is enabled

### Setting Completion Criteria

Before exporting, configure how completion is determined:

```
This course should mark as complete when the learner:
- Views all slides, OR
- Scores 80% on the final quiz, OR  
- Reaches the final page
```

The AI will implement appropriate SCORM tracking.

## Troubleshooting

- Check if pop-up blockers are interfering
- Verify the SCORM player settings in your LMS

### Progress not tracking?

- Complete the entire course to trigger tracking
- Check LMS SCORM settings for tracking options
- Some actions (like browser close) may not save progress

### Audio/images missing?

- Large media files may exceed LMS limits
- Re-export with compressed assets
- Host large media externally and link to it
