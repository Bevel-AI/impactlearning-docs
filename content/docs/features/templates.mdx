### Customizing Templates

Templates are fully customizable. After selecting a template, you can:

- **Change the content** — Replace placeholder text with your material
- **Adjust the design** — Modify colors, fonts, and layouts
- **Add features** — Include assessments, videos, or interactive elements
- **Remove sections** — Take out parts you don't need

**Example prompt:**
```
Using this Code of Conduct template, replace the content with 
our company's data privacy policy. Use a blue color scheme 
instead of the default colors.
```

## Template vs. From Scratch

| Approach | Best When |
|----------|-----------|
| **Template** | You want a proven structure and faster start |
| **From Scratch** | You have a unique vision or specific requirements |

Most users find templates save significant time, even when heavily customized.

## Custom Templates (Business)

Business plan users can create custom templates from their projects:

1. Build a project you want to reuse
2. Save it as a template (coming soon)
3. Use it as a starting point for future projects

This is ideal for maintaining brand consistency across multiple learning programs.
