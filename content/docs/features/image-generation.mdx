# Image Generation

Impact Learning can generate custom images for your learning content using AI. Create illustrations, diagrams, icons, and more — all from text descriptions.

## What Can You Generate?

### Illustrations

- Characters and people (diverse representation)
- Workplace scenarios
- Product visualizations
- Conceptual representations

### Diagrams and Charts

- Process flows
- Organizational charts
- Comparison visuals
- Step-by-step instructions

### Icons and Graphics

- Custom icons matching your style
- Decorative elements
- Section headers
- Background patterns

## How to Generate Images

### In Your Prompts

Ask for images as part of your content request:

```
Create a lesson about proper hand washing with:
- An illustration showing the 6-step process
- Icons for each step
- A "do vs don't" comparison image
```

### Dedicated Image Requests

Request specific images:

```
Generate an illustration of a diverse team in a 
modern office having a positive meeting. Use a 
warm, professional style with soft colors.
```

## Aspect Ratios

Choose the right dimensions for your use case:

| Ratio | Dimensions | Best For |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **1:1** | Square | Profile images, icons, thumbnails |
| **16:9** | Landscape | Hero images, presentation slides |
| **9:16** | Portrait | Mobile content, vertical displays |
| **4:3** | Standard | General content, documentation |

Specify the ratio in your prompt:

```
Create a 16:9 hero image showing a student 
learning on a laptop with a celebratory mood.
```

## Style Guidelines

### Be Descriptive

**Good prompt:**
```
A friendly cartoon-style illustration of a customer 
service representative helping a smiling customer. 
Use bright, warm colors with a clean white background. 
The style should be modern and approachable, suitable 
for corporate training.
```

**Less effective:**
```
Customer service image
```

### Specify the Style

Common styles you can request:

- **Flat design** — Modern, minimalist, solid colors
- **Isometric** — 3D-like with consistent angles
- **Watercolor** — Soft, artistic, approachable
- **Line art** — Clean outlines, professional
- **Photorealistic** — Lifelike images
- **Cartoon/Illustrated** — Friendly, engaging

### Include Context

Tell the AI how the image will be used:

```
This image will be the header for a safety training module. 
It should convey professionalism and care, showing workers 
wearing proper PPE in a manufacturing environment.
```

## Supported Models

Impact Learning uses these image generation models:

| Model | Strengths |
|-------|-----------|
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** | Fast generation, good for iteration |
| **Gemini 3.0 Pro Image** | Higher quality, better prompt following |
| **GPT Image 1.5** | Strong photorealistic capabilities |

The system automatically selects the best model, or you can specify in Settings.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Describe the mood and emotion you want
- Specify colors that match your brand
- Include context about the audience
- Request multiple options if unsure

### Avoid

- Requesting real people or celebrities
- Copyrighted characters or logos
- Overly complex scenes with many elements
- Text in images (AI text rendering is imperfect)

## Uploading vs. Generating

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Generate** | Need custom illustrations, no existing assets |
| **Upload** | Have brand photos, specific images required |
| **Combine** | Use uploaded images as reference for generated style |

## Image Credits

Image generation uses credits from your plan:

| Quality | Credit Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Standard quality | 2 credits |
| High quality | 3-4 credits |
| Multiple variations | 2 credits each |
