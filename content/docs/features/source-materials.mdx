# Source Materials

Upload your existing materials — documents, images, videos, and more — to help Impact Learning create content that's accurate and tailored to your needs.

## Why Upload Source Materials?

When you provide source materials, the AI can:

- **Extract key information** from your documents
- **Maintain accuracy** by referencing your actual content
- **Follow your brand guidelines** from uploaded style guides
- **Include your visuals** directly in the learning content

## Supported File Formats

### Documents

| Format | Extension | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| PDF | `.pdf` | Training manuals, policies, reports |
| Markdown | `.md` | Structured text, existing documentation |

### Images

| Format | Extension | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| PNG | `.png` | Screenshots, diagrams, logos |
| JPEG | `.jpg`, `.jpeg` | Photos, complex images |
| GIF | `.gif` | Simple animations |
| WebP | `.webp` | Modern web images |

### Video

| Format | Extension | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| MP4 | `.mp4` | Most video content |
| WebM | `.webm` | Web-optimized video |
| MOV | `.mov` | Apple/professional video |
| AVI | `.avi` | Legacy video files |

## How to Upload

### Drag and Drop

The simplest method:

1. Drag files from your computer
2. Drop them into the chat area
3. Files upload automatically

### Click to Upload

1. Click the **attachment button** (📎) in the chat input
2. Select files from your computer
3. Click **Open** to upload

### Paste YouTube Links

For YouTube videos, simply paste the URL in the chat:

```
Here's a video I want to include: https://youtube.com/watch?v=...
```

## Using Uploaded Materials

### Reference in Your Prompts

After uploading, tell the AI how to use the materials:

```
Using the uploaded PDF, create a 5-lesson course covering 
the main topics. Keep the same terminology and include 
the key statistics mentioned in the document.
```

### Combine Multiple Sources

You can upload several files and reference them together:

```
I've uploaded our brand guidelines (PDF) and product photos (images). 
Create a product training course that follows our brand colors 
and includes the product images in relevant lessons.
```

## Best Practices

### Do Upload

- **Source documents** that contain the information you want to teach
- **Brand assets** like logos and color guides
- **Existing training materials** you want to modernize
- **Reference images** showing what you want to create

### Avoid Uploading

- **Sensitive data** that shouldn't be processed by AI
- **Very large files** (break into smaller chunks if possible)
- **Copyrighted content** you don't have rights to use

## File Size Limits

| Plan | Max File Size | Max Total per Chat |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Free | 10 MB | 50 MB |
| Pro | 25 MB | 250 MB |

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific** about what information to extract from documents
2. **Name files clearly** so you can reference them in prompts
3. **Upload relevant sections** rather than entire large documents
4. **Include context** about what each file contains
