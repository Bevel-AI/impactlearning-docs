# Publishing

When your learning content is ready, publish it to make it accessible to learners. Impact Learning provides multiple publishing options to fit your needs.

## Publishing Options

### Public Publishing

Content is accessible to anyone with the link:

- No login required for learners
- Shareable URL for easy distribution
- Indexed by search engines (optional)
- Best for: Open courses, marketing content, public resources

### Restricted Publishing

Content requires authentication or a special link:

- Only authorized users can access
- Share links with optional passwords
- Access tracking and analytics
- Best for: Internal training, paid courses, sensitive content

## How to Publish

### Step 1: Open the Publish Dialog

1. Click the **Publish** button in the preview toolbar
2. Or use the keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)

### Step 2: Configure Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | Display name for the published content |
| **Description** | Brief summary shown in previews and shares |
| **Visibility** | Public or restricted access |

### Step 3: Publish

Click **Publish** and wait for the build to complete. You'll see:

1. **Building** — Content is being prepared
2. **Uploading** — Files are being deployed
3. **Ready** — Your content is live!

## Your Published URL

After publishing, you get a permanent URL:

```
https://impactlearning.app/p/{publishId}/
```

This URL remains stable even if you update the content later.

### Latest Version URL

Each project also has a "latest" URL that always points to the most recent publish:

```
https://impactlearning.app/p/chat/{chatId}/
```

Share this URL if you want learners to always access the newest version.

## Sharing Published Content

### Direct Link

Copy the URL and share via:

- Email
- Messaging apps
- Learning Management Systems
- Intranet pages

### Embed

Embed your content in other websites:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://impactlearning.app/p/{publishId}/"
  width="100%" 
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>
```

### QR Code

Generate a QR code for the URL to share in:

- Printed materials
- Presentations
- Physical spaces

## Publishing Best Practices

### Before Publishing

- [ ] Test all interactive elements
- [ ] Check mobile view
- [ ] Review for typos and errors
- [ ] Verify images and audio load correctly

### For Internal Training

- Create share links with expiration
- Track completion through your LMS

### For Public Content

- Test the share preview
- Consider a custom domain for branding

## Troubleshooting

### Publish stuck on "Building"?

- Wait a few moments — complex content takes longer
- Check for errors in the chat history
- Try refreshing the page

### Content not updating?

- Clear your browser cache
- Wait 1-2 minutes for CDN propagation
- Verify you're viewing the correct URL

### Custom domain not working?

- Verify DNS records are correct
- DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours
- Check the domain status in Settings
