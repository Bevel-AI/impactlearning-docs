# Live Preview

Impact Learning provides a real-time preview panel that shows your content as it's being generated. Watch your learning experiences come to life instantly without waiting for builds or deployments.

## How It Works

As you chat with the AI to create content, the preview panel on the right side of your screen updates automatically:

1. **Describe your content** in the chat
2. **Watch the preview** update in real-time
3. **Request changes** and see them applied instantly
4. **Switch between views** to test different devices

## View Modes

### Desktop View

The default full-width view shows how your content appears on desktop browsers and laptops. This is ideal for:

- Course platforms with sidebars
- Content with wide layouts
- Multi-column designs

### Mobile View

Switch to mobile view to see how your content looks on smartphones. The preview shows:

- Actual mobile dimensions (375 × 667px, simulating iPhone)
- How navigation adapts to smaller screens
- Touch-friendly interface elements

**Tip:** Always test your content in mobile view if learners will access it on phones.

## Preview Controls

The preview toolbar provides quick access to:

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Desktop/Mobile toggle** | Switch between device views |
| **Reload** | Refresh the preview manually |
| **Fullscreen** | Open preview in a new tab |
| **Publish** | Deploy your content to the web |

## Real-Time Updates

The preview automatically refreshes when:

- AI generates new content
- You modify existing content
- Files are created or updated
- Images or audio are generated

You don't need to manually trigger builds — the preview stays in sync with your latest changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Preview not updating?

If the preview seems stuck:

1. Click the **Reload** button in the preview toolbar
2. Check if there are any errors in the chat
3. Wait for the AI to finish generating content

### Content looks different than expected?

- Switch between desktop and mobile views to see how layouts adapt
- Check if the AI is still generating content (look for the loading indicator)
- Review the chat history for any error messages

## Best Practices

1. **Check mobile view early** — Don't wait until the end to test mobile layouts
2. **Iterate in small steps** — Make incremental changes and verify each one
3. **Use the preview to guide prompts** — If something doesn't look right, describe the specific change you want
