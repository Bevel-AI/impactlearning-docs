# Content Generation

Impact Learning uses advanced AI models to generate learning content from your descriptions. Simply describe what you want, and watch complete learning experiences come to life.

## What Can AI Generate?

### Text Content

- **Lesson text** with clear explanations
- **Instructions** for activities
- **Summaries** and key takeaways
- **Quiz questions** with feedback
- **Scenario dialogues** for role-play

### Interactive Elements

- **Multiple choice questions** with explanations
- **Drag-and-drop activities**
- **Branching scenarios** with consequences
- **Progress trackers** and completion indicators
- **Navigation systems** for multi-page content

### Complete Experiences

- **Full courses** with multiple lessons
- **Assessment modules** with scoring
- **Gamified learning** with points and badges
- **Scenario simulations** with decision trees

## How It Works

### 1. Describe Your Vision

Tell the AI what you want to create:

```
Create a customer service training with 3 scenarios:
1. Handling a product return
2. Dealing with an angry customer  
3. Upselling additional services

Each scenario should have 4-5 decision points with 
realistic dialogue options and consequences.
```

### 2. AI Generates Content

The AI creates:

- Complete scenario structures
- Realistic dialogue for each character
- Multiple choice options at decision points
- Feedback for each choice
- Visual layout and styling

### 3. Preview and Iterate

See the content in the live preview, then refine:

```
The second scenario is too long. Condense it to 3 
decision points and make the customer's tone more 
frustrated from the start.
```

## Effective Prompting

### Be Specific

**Good:**
```
Create a 5-question quiz about workplace safety, focusing on:
- Fire evacuation procedures
- Proper lifting techniques
- Chemical handling
Include explanations for both correct and incorrect answers.
```

**Less Effective:**
```
Make a safety quiz
```

### Provide Context

Tell the AI about your audience and goals:

```
This training is for new retail employees (18-25 years old) 
who may have no prior customer service experience. Use 
casual, friendly language and include relatable examples.
```

### Request Specific Formats

```
Present this as a timeline with:
- Year markers on the left
- Event descriptions on the right
- Images or icons for each major event
- A progress indicator showing current position
```

## Model Selection

Different AI models have different strengths. Impact Learning supports:

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **Claude Sonnet** | Balanced content generation (default) |
| **Claude Opus** | Complex scenarios, nuanced writing |
| **GPT-5.2** | Technical content, code examples |
| **Gemini 3.0** | Visual descriptions, creative content |

Change models in Settings if you need different capabilities for specific projects.

## Tips for Better Content

### Structure First

Ask for an outline before generating full content:

```
Before creating the full course, give me an outline of:
- Module titles
- Lesson topics within each module
- Estimated duration for each lesson
```

### Iterate in Chunks

For large projects, build section by section:

```
Let's start with Module 1, Lesson 1. Create the introduction 
and first interactive activity.
```

### Use Examples

Provide examples of the style you want:

```
Here's an example of the tone I want:
"Great choice! Offering a refund shows the customer you 
value their satisfaction. This builds long-term loyalty."

Generate feedback in this encouraging, conversational style.
```

## Credits and Generation

Content generation uses credits from your plan:

| Action | Approximate Credit Cost |
|--------|------------------------|
| Simple text generation | 1 credit |
| Complex interactive element | 2-3 credits |
| Full scenario with branching | 5-10 credits |
| Complete course outline | 3-5 credits |

See [Plans and Credits](/docs/plans-and-credits) for more details on credit usage.
