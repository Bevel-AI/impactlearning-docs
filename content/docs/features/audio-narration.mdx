# Audio Narration

Impact Learning can generate professional voice narration for your content. Add audio to make your learning experiences more engaging and accessible.

## Why Use Audio Narration?

### Accessibility

Audio narration makes content accessible to:

- Learners with visual impairments
- People who prefer auditory learning
- Users in situations where reading is difficult

### Engagement

Voice adds a human element that:

- Keeps learners focused
- Adds emotional tone to content
- Makes scenarios more realistic
- Creates a more immersive experience

### Multi-Modal Learning

Research shows combining visual and audio content improves:

- Information retention
- Understanding of complex topics
- Learner satisfaction

## How to Generate Audio

### Automatic Narration

Ask for narration as part of your content:

```
Create a lesson about fire safety procedures. Include 
audio narration for each section that guides the 
learner through the content.
```

### Specific Audio Requests

Generate audio for existing content:

```
Add audio narration to the introduction slide. Use a 
warm, professional tone that welcomes new employees 
to the training.
```

### Character Voices

For scenarios and role-plays:

```
Generate dialogue audio for this customer service 
scenario. The customer should sound frustrated but 
not angry, and the representative should be calm 
and helpful.
```

## Voice Options

You can request different voice characteristics:

| Style | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **Professional** | Corporate training, formal content |

```
"Welcome to our safety training. Over the next twenty 
minutes, you'll learn how to identify hazards... and 
respond to emergencies. Let's get started."
```

### Pacing

Control the pace with your writing:

- **Commas** create brief pauses
- **Periods** create longer pauses
- **Ellipses (...)** create dramatic pauses
- **Exclamation points** add emphasis

### Quality Checks

Always preview generated audio to check:

- Pronunciation of technical terms
- Natural flow and pacing
- Appropriate tone for the content
- Volume consistency

## Audio in Your Content

### Placement Options

- **Click-to-play** — Learner controls when audio plays
- **Background** — Accompanies visual content
- **Standalone** — Primary content delivery

### With Captions

For accessibility, pair audio with text captions:

```
Add audio narration to this lesson and include 
synchronized captions below the audio player.
```

## Audio Credits

Audio generation uses credits based on length:

| Duration | Approximate Credit Cost |
|----------|------------------------|
| Short (< 30 sec) | 1 credit |
| Medium (30 sec - 2 min) | 2 credits |
| Long (2-5 min) | 3-5 credits |
