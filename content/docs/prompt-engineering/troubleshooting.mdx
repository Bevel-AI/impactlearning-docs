# Troubleshooting

When results don't match your expectations, these troubleshooting strategies can help you get back on track.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Output is too generic

**Symptom:** Content feels templated, not specific to your needs.

**Cause:** Prompt lacks specific context about your organization, audience, or goals.

**Solution:** Add specificity:

```
Before: "Create safety training"

After: "Create forklift safety training for our Amazon warehouse 
in Phoenix. The audience is seasonal workers (18-25) who may not 
speak English as a first language. Focus on the most common 
accident types we've seen: tip-overs and pedestrian collisions."
```

### Content is too long

**Symptom:** Output is overwhelming, takes too long to complete.

**Cause:** No constraints on length or time.

**Solution:** Add explicit limits:

```
Keep this training to:
- 10 minutes maximum completion time
- 3 key concepts (no more)
- 5 quiz questions
- 1 scenario (not multiple)
```

### Content is too short

**Symptom:** Output feels incomplete or superficial.

**Cause:** Prompt didn't indicate depth needed.

**Solution:** Request more detail:

```
Expand on this by:
- Adding more explanation for each concept
- Including 2-3 examples per section
- Adding "deep dive" optional content
- Including a comprehensive quiz (15+ questions)
```

### Wrong tone or style

**Symptom:** Content sounds too formal, too casual, or doesn't match brand.

**Cause:** Style expectations not communicated.

**Solution:** Define tone explicitly:

```
Adjust the writing style:
- Use "you" and "we" instead of "the learner" and "the company"
- Write at an 8th-grade reading level
- Be encouraging, not instructive
- Add subtle humor where appropriate
- Avoid corporate jargon entirely
```

### Technical errors in preview

**Symptom:** Preview shows errors, missing content, or broken layouts.

**Cause:** Usually a generation issue that can be fixed.

**Solution:** Report what you see:

```
The preview shows some issues:
- Image on slide 3 isn't loading
- Text overlaps the button on mobile view
- Quiz submit button isn't working

Please fix these technical issues.
```

### AI misunderstood the request

**Symptom:** Output is well-made but completely different from what you wanted.

**Cause:** Ambiguous language or unclear context.

**Solution:** Clarify and try again:

```
I think there was a misunderstanding. When I said "cards," I meant 
flashcard-style learning cards that flip to show answers, not 
the card-based navigation you created.

Please recreate using flashcards instead.
```

## Debugging Prompts

### When something breaks

Use this pattern to get help:

```
I'm seeing an issue:

WHAT I EXPECTED: [Describe what should happen]
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS: [Describe what you see]
WHEN IT OCCURS: [Steps to reproduce]

Please help me fix this.
```

### When you're stuck

If you're not sure how to proceed:

```
I want to create [goal] but I'm not sure how to approach it.
My constraints are:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

Can you suggest an approach and outline before we build it?
```

### When results vary

If you're getting inconsistent results:

```
I've tried this prompt twice and got very different results.
What I need is consistent:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

Can you ensure these elements are always included?
```

## Prevention Strategies

### Use Checklists

Before complex prompts, ensure you've included:

- [ ] Clear goal statement
- [ ] Target audience description
- [ ] Specific requirements (numbered)
- [ ] Constraints (time, length, format)
- [ ] Style/tone guidance
- [ ] Success criteria

### Start with an Outline

For complex projects:

```
Before building the full content, give me an outline showing:
- Module/section structure
- Key content points for each
- Estimated duration
- Interactive elements planned

Once I approve, we'll build each section.
```

### Define Non-Goals

Sometimes saying what you don't want is as helpful as what you do:

```
Important: This training should NOT include:
- Historical background (focus on current procedures)
- Technical specifications (keep it practical)
- Legal disclaimers (we'll add those separately)
- Optional advanced content (this is basics only)
```

## Getting Help

### If content won't generate

```
I'm trying to create [X] but it's not working.
I've tried: [What you attempted]
Error/issue: [What happens]

What should I try instead?
```

### If you need a different approach

```
The approach we've been taking isn't working for my needs.
The problem is: [Describe the issue]
What I actually need is: [Describe the goal]

Can we try a completely different approach?
```

### If you're not sure what's possible

```
Is it possible to create [X] with Impact Learning?
I'm trying to achieve: [Goal]
Constraints I have: [Limitations]

If yes, what's the best approach?
If no, what's the closest alternative?
```

## Recovery Strategies

### When you've gone down the wrong path

```
Let's pause here. The direction we've taken isn't working.
I'd like to go back to basics and start with just:
- [Simple element 1]
- [Simple element 2]

Once those work, we can add complexity.
```

### When content is partially good

```
Some of this works well:
- KEEP: [What to preserve]

But other parts need to change:
- CHANGE: [What to modify]
- REMOVE: [What to delete]

Please update accordingly.
```

### When you need to reset

```
Let's start fresh. Clear our previous attempts and create
a new [content type] with these requirements:

[New, clearer requirements]
```

## FAQ

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why does the same prompt give different results?">
AI models have some variability in their outputs. To get more consistent results:
- Be more specific in your requirements
- Include examples of what you want
- Define constraints clearly
- Save/publish versions you like
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I fix broken interactive elements?">
Describe the exact issue you see:
- What should happen when you click/interact
- What actually happens instead
- Any error messages visible

The AI can usually fix technical issues when given specific details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I undo changes?">
There's no automatic undo, but you can:
- Describe the previous state and ask to restore it
- Reference earlier content in the conversation
- Keep copies of versions you like by publishing them
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if the AI keeps making the same mistake?">
Try:
- Rephrasing your requirement differently
- Giving an example of correct vs incorrect
- Breaking the task into smaller steps
- Being explicit: "Do NOT [thing to avoid]"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I report bugs?">
Use the support channel with:
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots if helpful
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
