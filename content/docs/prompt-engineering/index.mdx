# Prompt Engineering

Getting great results from Impact Learning starts with effective prompting. This section covers techniques, patterns, and examples to help you communicate clearly with the AI and create exactly what you envision.

## Why Prompting Matters

Impact Learning uses advanced AI models to generate learning content. The quality of your output depends significantly on how you communicate your needs. Good prompts lead to:

- **More accurate results** on the first try
- **Fewer iterations** needed
- **Better understanding** of your intent
- **More creative and appropriate** outputs

## Quick Tips

### Be Specific

Instead of:
```
Make a training about safety
```

Try:
```
Create a workplace safety training for warehouse employees covering:
1. Forklift operation safety
2. Proper lifting techniques
3. Emergency evacuation procedures

Include a quiz at the end with 10 questions.
```

### Provide Context

Tell the AI about your audience, goals, and constraints:

```
This training is for new hires (ages 18-25) in retail. They have 
no prior experience. Use casual, friendly language and include 
relatable examples from common retail scenarios.
```

### Iterate in Chunks

For large projects, build piece by piece:

```
Let's start with the first module. Create the introduction 
and the first interactive scenario.
```

Then continue:

```
Great, now create the second scenario about handling 
customer complaints.
```

## Prompt Structure

A well-structured prompt typically includes:

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Goal** | What you want to create | "Create a customer service training" |
| **Details** | Specific requirements | "with 3 scenarios and a final quiz" |
| **Audience** | Who will use it | "for new retail employees" |
| **Style** | Tone and format | "professional but approachable" |
| **Constraints** | Limitations | "keep each scenario under 5 minutes" |

## Example Prompts

### Scenario-Based Training

```
Create an interactive scenario for practicing difficult 
conversations with employees. The learner is a manager who 
needs to give feedback about missed deadlines.

Include:
- 4 decision points with realistic dialogue options
- Consequences that show impact of each choice
- Coaching feedback after each decision
- A summary of best practices at the end

Tone: Professional but empathetic
```

### Assessment Module

```
Build a compliance quiz about data privacy with:
- 15 multiple choice questions
- Questions covering GDPR, data handling, and breach reporting
- Immediate feedback explaining why answers are correct/incorrect
- A passing score of 80%
- Certificate display upon completion
```

### Gamified Learning

```
Create a weekly learning game about product knowledge.
- 5 rounds of increasing difficulty
- Points for correct answers (bonus for speed)
- Visual progress and score display
- Celebratory animation for high scores
- Option to replay for better score
```
