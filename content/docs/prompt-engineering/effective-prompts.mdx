# Writing Effective Prompts

The way you communicate with Impact Learning directly affects the quality of your output. This guide covers the fundamentals of writing prompts that get results.

## The STAR Framework

Use the STAR framework for comprehensive prompts:

### Situation

Describe the context and background:

```
We're creating onboarding training for a software company. 
New employees come from various backgrounds and may not 
have tech experience.
```

### Task

Clearly state what you want:

```
Create an interactive module teaching employees how to 
use our internal ticketing system.
```

### Audience

Define who will use the content:

```
Target audience: New hires in customer support, ages 22-35, 
comfortable with computers but unfamiliar with our specific tools.
```

### Requirements

List specific needs and constraints:

```
Requirements:
- 5-7 minute completion time
- Include step-by-step walkthrough
- Add practice exercises after each section
- Use screenshots of the actual interface
- End with a 5-question knowledge check
```

## Specificity Levels

### Too Vague

```
Make safety training
```

**Problem:** No context about topic, audience, format, or length.

### Better

```
Create safety training for our warehouse team
```

**Improvement:** Adds topic and audience, but lacks detail.

### Best

```
Create forklift safety training for warehouse employees with:
- Pre-operation checklist walkthrough
- 3 scenarios showing common hazards
- Emergency procedure guide
- 10-question assessment (80% to pass)
- Estimated duration: 20 minutes
- Tone: Serious but not alarming
```

**Why it works:** Clear scope, specific requirements, defined success criteria.

## Prompt Components

### Opening Statement

Start with what you want to create:

- "Create a..." 
- "Build an interactive..."
- "Design a scenario where..."
- "Generate a quiz about..."

### Content Specifications

Detail what should be included:

```
Include:
- Introduction explaining why this matters
- 3 main sections with examples
- Interactive elements in each section
- Summary with key takeaways
```

### Format Guidelines

Specify how content should be structured:

```
Format:
- Use bullet points for procedures
- Include images for each major step
- Add audio narration for accessibility
- Mobile-friendly layout
```

### Style Direction

Guide the tone and visual approach:

```
Style:
- Professional but approachable
- Use company colors (blue #0066CC, gray #333333)
- Modern, clean design
- Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
```

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- **Be explicit** about what you want and don't want
- **Use examples** when describing a desired style or format
- **Break down complex requests** into smaller parts
- **Specify quantities** (number of questions, scenarios, sections)
- **Define success** (what does "done" look like?)

### Don't

- **Assume the AI knows your context** — provide background
- **Use ambiguous terms** without definition ("make it good")
- **Ask for everything at once** in complex projects
- **Skip the audience** — who uses this matters
- **Forget constraints** — time, length, technical limits

## Formatting Your Prompts

### Use Structure

Structured prompts are easier to process:

```
GOAL: Customer service scenario training

AUDIENCE: 
- New support representatives
- No prior customer service experience
- Ages 20-30

CONTENT:
1. Greeting and opening scenarios
2. Handling complaints
3. Escalation procedures
4. Closing conversations positively

FORMAT:
- Interactive branching scenarios
- Audio for customer dialogue
- Visual feedback on choices
- Score tracking

CONSTRAINTS:
- 15 minutes total
- 4 scenarios maximum
- Mobile-compatible
```

### Use Markdown

Impact understands markdown formatting:

```
Create training with these sections:

## Module 1: Introduction
- Welcome message
- Learning objectives
- How to navigate

## Module 2: Core Concepts
- Definition of key terms
- **Important**: Highlight compliance requirements
- Examples with visuals

## Module 3: Assessment
- 10 multiple choice questions
- Immediate feedback
- Certificate upon 80% pass rate
```

## Examples by Content Type

### For Scenarios

```
Create a branching scenario about [topic]:

Setting: [describe the situation]
Learner role: [who they play]
Goal: [what they need to achieve]

Include:
- Initial situation setup
- [X] decision points
- Realistic dialogue options
- Consequences for each choice
- Debrief explaining best practices
```

### For Assessments

```
Create an assessment about [topic]:

Question types: [multiple choice, true/false, etc.]
Number of questions: [X]
Difficulty: [beginner/intermediate/advanced]
Passing score: [X%]

Include:
- Clear, unambiguous questions
- Plausible distractors
- Feedback for each answer
- Final score and review option
```

### For Interactive Content

```
Create interactive content teaching [skill/topic]:

Interaction type: [drag-drop, click-reveal, etc.]
Learning objective: [what they'll be able to do]
Scaffolding: [how difficulty progresses]

Include:
- Instructions for the learner
- Immediate feedback on actions
- Option to retry
- Connection to real-world application
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: The Kitchen Sink

**Bad:**
```
Create a complete onboarding program with videos, quizzes, 
scenarios, certificates, gamification, social features, 
analytics, multiple languages, accessibility features, 
custom branding, and integration with our LMS.
```

**Better:** Start with one module, then expand.

### Mistake 2: No Success Criteria

**Bad:**
```
Make the training engaging
```

**Better:**
```
Make the training engaging by:
- Adding a scenario every 3 minutes
- Including interactive elements learners must complete
- Using conversational, friendly language
- Adding progress indicators
```

### Mistake 3: Conflicting Requirements

**Bad:**
```
Create a comprehensive, detailed training that's also 
quick and simple to complete in 5 minutes.
```

**Better:** Choose one focus or split into multiple modules.
