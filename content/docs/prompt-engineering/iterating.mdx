# Iterating and Refining

Great learning content rarely emerges perfect on the first try. This guide covers how to effectively iterate with Impact Learning to refine your content until it matches your vision.

## The Iteration Mindset

Think of creating content as a conversation, not a single request:

1. **Initial prompt** → Get a starting point
2. **Review** → Identify what works and what doesn't
3. **Refine** → Guide improvements with specific feedback
4. **Repeat** → Continue until satisfied

## Types of Follow-Up Prompts

### Modification Requests

Change specific aspects while keeping the rest:

```
Keep the overall structure, but:
- Make the introduction shorter
- Add more examples in section 2
- Change the quiz from 10 to 5 questions
```

### Expansion Requests

Add more content to existing structure:

```
This looks good. Now add:
- A scenario between sections 2 and 3
- Audio narration for the introduction
- A summary slide at the end
```

### Style Adjustments

Change the tone or visual approach:

```
The content is correct, but adjust the style:
- Use more casual, conversational language
- Add more white space between sections
- Make the colors warmer (less corporate blue)
```

### Targeting Requests

Focus on a specific element:

```
The third scenario needs work:
- Make the customer response more realistic
- Add a fourth decision point
- Include body language cues
```

## Effective Feedback Language

### Be Specific

**Vague:**
```
Make it better
```

**Specific:**
```
The quiz questions are too easy. Make them more challenging by:
- Adding scenario-based questions instead of simple recall
- Including "best answer" questions with multiple correct options
- Adding questions that require applying concepts
```

### Use Comparisons

```
The introduction is good, but make it more like the 
conclusion - direct and action-oriented, without the 
lengthy background explanation.
```

### Reference the Preview

```
Looking at the preview, I notice:
- The text on slide 3 is hard to read against the background
- The transition between scenario 1 and 2 feels abrupt
- The final score display is too small

Please fix these issues.
```

## Iteration Patterns

### The Narrow-Down Pattern

Start broad, then focus:

```
1st prompt: "Create customer service training"
2nd prompt: "Focus more on handling complaints"
3rd prompt: "In the complaint scenario, add de-escalation techniques"
4th prompt: "Add a specific example about product defects"
```

### The Build-Up Pattern

Add layers of complexity:

```
1st prompt: "Create a basic quiz about safety"
2nd prompt: "Add feedback for each answer"
3rd prompt: "Include images for each question"
4th prompt: "Add a timer and point system"
```

### The A/B Pattern

Try different approaches:

```
1st prompt: "Create scenario with serious tone"
[Review]
2nd prompt: "Actually, let's try a more casual approach 
instead - make it conversational and friendly"
```

## Keeping Context

Impact remembers your conversation, so you can reference previous work:

### Reference by Position

```
In the second scenario you created, change the 
customer's initial reaction from angry to confused.
```

### Reference by Description

```
In the quiz section where we ask about emergency 
procedures, add two more questions.
```

### Reference Changes Made

```
You just updated the introduction - now apply that 
same direct style to all the section headers.
```

## When to Start Over

Sometimes iterating isn't the best path. Consider starting fresh when:

- The fundamental structure doesn't match your needs
- You've changed your mind about the overall approach
- The conversation is getting confused
- You have a much clearer idea now than when you started

To start fresh:

```
Let's take a different approach. Start over and create 
[new description] instead of building on what we have.
```

## Saving Good Work

Before major iterations, consider:

1. **Publishing** a version you like (you can always unpublish)
2. **Noting** what works in your prompt: "Keep the quiz format exactly as is, but change..."
3. **Being explicit** about what not to change: "Don't modify sections 1 and 2, only update section 3"

## Common Iteration Scenarios

### "It's close but not quite right"

```
This is 80% what I want. The things to change:

KEEP:
- Overall structure
- Quiz format
- Visual style

CHANGE:
- Shorten the introduction
- Add more realistic dialogue
- Fix the typo in scenario 2
```

### "I changed my mind about scope"

```
Looking at this, I realize we need less content, not more.
Simplify by:
- Reducing from 5 scenarios to 3
- Shortening each scenario to 3 decision points
- Removing the bonus content section
```

### "The style isn't working"

```
The content is accurate, but the style needs a complete change:
- Current: Formal, corporate
- Wanted: Casual, conversational

Rewrite all text to be more approachable and friendly.
Use contractions, shorter sentences, and add a touch of humor.
```

### "I need to add requirements I forgot"

```
I forgot to mention some requirements. Please update to:
- Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
- Add audio narration throughout
- Include a downloadable PDF summary
- Make sure it works on mobile devices
```

## Pro Tips for Effective Iteration

1. **One thing at a time**: Focus iterations on specific improvements
2. **Be positive**: Say what you want, not just what you don't want
3. **Use the preview**: Reference what you actually see
4. **Trust the context**: The AI remembers what you've built together
5. **Know when to stop**: Perfect is the enemy of done
