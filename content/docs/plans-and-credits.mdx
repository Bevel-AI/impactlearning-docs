## Credits

Credits are used when generating learning content in Impact. The cost depends on the complexity of what you're creating.

### How Credits Are Used

Different actions consume different amounts of credits based on complexity:

| Action | Description | Approximate Credits |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Simple edit | Change colors, text, or styling | 0.5 |
| Add component | Add a quiz question or interactive element | 1.0 |
| Generate section | Create a new lesson or scenario branch | 1.5 |
| Full experience | Build a complete gamified module or assessment | 2.0-3.0 |
| Image generation | AI-generated images for your content | 0.5 |
| Audio narration | AI-generated voice narration | 1.0 |

### Credit Display

To view your remaining credits:
1. Open the sidebar in the Impact dashboard
2. Your credit balance is displayed at the bottom of the sidebar
3. The credit bar shows used vs. remaining credits for the current billing period

### Credit Rollovers

Unused monthly credits automatically roll over at the end of each billing cycle, as long as you maintain an active subscription:

- **Monthly plans**: Rolled-over credits are valid for one additional month
- **Annual plans**: Rolled-over credits are valid for the remainder of your annual subscription

<Callout type="warn">
Daily credits on the Free plan do **not** roll over. Unused daily credits expire at the end of each day (midnight UTC).
